# Session Notes - Issue #1069
## Date: 2025-01-14
## Next Session Reminders

## Branch Context
- **Working in**: `issue-1069-test-coverage` branch (not DynamicSearch!)
- **Branch is behind main**: Will need to sync/merge main when resuming work
- **Commits made**: Test file renames and CLAUDE.md updates are committed
- **Important**: Always verify branch with `git status` at start of session

## Critical Finding - HIGH RISK
- **ShellViewModel has only 6% coverage** - This is a HIGH RISK that needs immediate attention
- Only `TreeViewNodeClicked` is partially tested
- **`SaveModel` is completely untested** - DATA LOSS RISK!
- 16 out of 17 public methods have no tests

## DynamicSearch Branch Note
- The DynamicSearch branch (not yet merged) adds search methods to the API:
  - SearchForText
  - SearchForReferences
  - RemoveReferences
  - SearchInSubtree
- SearchServiceTests.cs exists there but tests SearchService, not the API methods
- When DynamicSearch merges, will need to add API test coverage for these search methods

## Test File Status
- ✅ All test files renamed to match source files:
  - SemanticKernelApiTests.cs → SemanticKernelAPITests.cs
  - ShellTests.cs → ShellViewModelTests.cs
  - BackendTests.cs → BackendServiceTests.cs
  - ProblemVMTests.cs → ProblemViewModelTests.cs
  - LockTest.cs → LockTests.cs
  - ShellUITests.cs → Merged into StoryModelTests.cs
- ✅ Test methods follow `MethodName_Scenario_ExpectedResult` pattern
- ✅ Tests compile and run successfully with .NET 9
- ✅ 174 tests passing, 3 skipped

## Documentation Status
- All analysis reports are in `/mnt/d/dev/doc/projects/issue_1069_achieve_100_percent_api_and_outlineservice_coverage/`
  - API_Coverage_Analysis.md (87% coverage)
  - ShellViewModel_Coverage_Analysis.md (6% coverage)
  - OutlineService_Coverage_Analysis.md (60% coverage)
  - Test_Coverage_Gap_Analysis.md
  - README.md (index)
- Issue #1069 has been updated with progress and findings
- CLAUDE.md updated with:
  - Test naming conventions
  - Branch management guidelines
  - Branch syncing instructions

## Next Priority Tasks (P0 - Critical)
1. **ShellViewModel.SaveModel** - Critical data loss risk
2. **ShellViewModel.TreeViewNodeClicked** - Complete the testing (currently partial)
3. **API.SetCurrentModel** - Needed for Collaborator integration
4. **OutlineService.AddStoryElement** - Core functionality

## Next Priority Tasks (P1 - High)
1. ShellViewModel View Management (ViewChanged, ShowFlyoutButtons)
2. OutlineService Trash Operations (Remove/Restore/Empty)
3. ShellViewModel Move Operations (4 methods)

## Coverage Summary
| Component | Current | Target | Gap |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----|
| API | 87% (13/15) | 100% | 2 methods |
| ShellViewModel | 6% (1/17) | 100% | 16 methods |
| OutlineService | 60% (15/25+) | 100% | 10+ methods |
| **Overall** | **~51%** | **100%** | **28+ methods** |

## Key Accomplishments This Session
- ✅ Created correct branch for issue #1069
- ✅ Renamed all test files to match naming convention
- ✅ Fixed test method names
- ✅ Completed comprehensive coverage analysis
- ✅ Identified critical risk in ShellViewModel (6% coverage)
- ✅ Updated GitHub issue with progress
- ✅ Created project documentation folder with all reports

## Notes for Next Session
1. Start by syncing branch with main: `git pull origin main`
2. Focus on ShellViewModel.SaveModel first (data loss risk)
3. Consider creating mock services for testing ShellViewModel
4. May need to refactor static methods for testability
5. The project has been upgraded to .NET 9 (check test paths)

## Session End Time
2025-01-14 Evening
