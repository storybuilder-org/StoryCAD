# What is StoryBuilder?

StoryBuilder is a free computer-aided design tool which helps writers rapidly create outlines that
help create saleable stories. It's CAD for fiction writers. The elements StoryBuilder works with 
are the elements of good fiction: realistic three dimensional characters who are engaged in 
meaningful and gripping problems, dramatic and suspenseful plots, and settings that appeal to the senses.

StoryBuilder is currently in beta test. If you're interested in becoming a beta tester, 
please email tcox@svsoft.com and ask for a copy of the software. Our goal is to distribute
the software through [Microsoft Store][6].

## Contribution

StoryBuilder is an odd duck, with its feet in two ponds: the user community of writers
and the community of developers. And, perhaps, in the Venn diagram of these two communities,
there are a few writer-develpers....

If you would like to join the StoryBuilder community and help make the software better,
here are some [ways to make StoryBuilder better][5].

### For writers

If you're strictly in the writer camp, welcome! You may want to mosey over to 
[User Documentation][2]. Better yet, become a beta tester and try the software for yourself.

### For Developers

If you're developer, welcome! A good starting place is to learn more about StoryBuilder,
so you should read the [User Documentation][2] and use the program a bit before you 
try to use it. 

Once you've read through this document are familiar with the program, take a look at 
[Programmer Notes][3].

## Copyright & License

is @Copyright Sevens Valley Software.

up and running.

## Acknowledgements

We are greatful beyond words for those who have helped bring StoryBuilder back to
