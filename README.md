# About StoryCAD

Our mission is to provide a free open-source resource for writers of all levels who struggle with the complexity of plotted fiction.

StoryCAD is an editor for fiction outlines from which writers can quickly create working drafts. It uses best-practice techniques and offers hundreds of suggestions for better stories. Put simply StoryCAD is CAD for fiction writers.

The elements StoryCAD works with are the elements of good fiction: realistic three 
dimensional characters who are engaged in meaningful and gripping problems, dramatic 
and suspenseful plots, and settings that appeal to the senses.

## Built With

* [WinUI 3][1]
* [Windows App SDK][2]
* [Windows Community Toolkit][3]
* [elmah.io][4]
* [NRtfTree][5] (maintained separately with asynchronous IO support)
* [Scrivener][6]

WinUI is the UI Framework for StoryCAD and is [source available](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/tree/main/src)

Windows Community Toolkit is available under the [MIT License][14].

elmah.io is a commercial cloud-based error logging and uptime monitor service. elmah.io graciously provides a [free subscription][15] to public repository open source projects. We are grateful for their support.

NRtfTree is available under the [GNU GPL V3 License][16]. We maintain our asynchronous IO fork in a separate repository.

[Scrivener][6] is a commercial writing application widely used by novelists, screenwriters, playwrights, and short fiction writers. 
StoryCAD contains a feature that inserts StoryCAD reports into a Scrivener project using their Scrivener 3 File Formatting Specification API. 

## Getting Started

StoryCAD is a duck with its feet in two ponds: the user community of writers and the community of developers. 

### For writers

If you are (or want to be) a fiction writer, welcome! StoryCAD is for you. An introduction to StoryCAD for users is the [User Documentation][9].

Our [YouTube videos][28] will help you learn more about StoryCAD.

You're welcome to try the software for yourself (it's free.) 

You can find complete documentation in the [User Manual][8], which also serves as online help for the program.

### For Developers

If you're a developer, welcome! A good starting place is to learn what StoryCAD is about, using the same [User Documentation][9].

Strictly from the code side, take a look at [Programmer Notes][10].

## Usage

You can learn more about StoryCAD from our [YouTube videos][28].

See the [open issues](https://github.com/StoryBuilder-org/StoryCAD/issues) for a complete list of proposed features and known bugs.
