# Contributing

Hello, and welcome! Thank you for wanting to help improve StoryCAD. Here's what you need to know.

If you have a question, make sure it isn't already answered. Our goal is to provide answers to the most frequently asked questions somewhere in the [Issues][1] or
[Discussions][3].

Another source of information is our Discord server. You can join it from [this link][4].

For developer documentation, see the [For Developers](https://storybuilder-org.github.io/StoryCAD/docs/For%20Developers/For_Developers.html) section of the manual.

The rest of this document discusses possible ways to help.

## Bugs

Nobody knows a program like the person who uses it the most: not even the guys who wrote it. 
Everyone who's ever used buggy program- and they're all buggy- knows that.

If you find StoryCAD useful, it's in your interest for it work properly. If you find
a bug, please report it by opening an [issue][1]. Select **New Issue** and pick the
**Bug Report** template.

Please provide as much context as possible, and if you want to work on a fix, we'll be forever grateful! 
Please try to test around for a bit to make sure you're dealing with a bug and not an issue in your implementation.
If possible, provide a demo which isolates the bug and turns it into its smallest possible representation. That would help a lot!

## Suggesting Improvements and Features

Got an outlining itch StoryCAD can't scratch? Tell us about it, either by
opening an [issue][1]. Select **New Issue** and select the **Feature Request**
template). 

Alternatively, you can develop your idea by starting a new [discussion][3]. We're always looking to make
StoryCAD better.

We'll try to prioritize new feature development that makes our users happy.
Toward that end, we'll put together a feature voting system soon. 
The goal is making StoryCAD more usable.

## Add to and correct our lists

One of StoryCAD's defining characteristics is the thousands of suggestions it offers
for hundreds of elements. If you're looking for an idea, a theme, a subject, a role, a plot 
twist, a location, or just about anything, you'll find a a drop-down list full of ideas and
examples. They're there to prevent those pauses when the keyboard stops and you just can't
come up with the thought you need.

No list is perfect, however. Many times when you're using StoryCAD, you'll browse a list's
contents and not see what you're looking for. If the omission is especially glaring, you 
might pass it along. There'a s channel, list-suggestions, on our [Discord server][4] for just that 
purpose. 

## Provide New Samples

The samples StoryCAD provides could use some company. If you're trying to get familiar
with StoryCAD, why not pick a favorite novel, short story, television episode, movie 
or stage play and outline it? The samples work best when the story's familiar. Star Wars,
anyone? 

There's a channel on our  [Discord server][4] for just that purpose. 

The process of creating an outline from prose is deconstruction, and you can learn a lot
by taking a story apart. Hint: If you're having problems, you might take a look at Cliffs Notes.
They're the deconstruction champs.
