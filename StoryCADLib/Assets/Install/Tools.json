The transformation is symbolic, and\nwhat he changes into is important for what it represents.\nThe transformation may have taken place earlier, but the story is\nabout the journey back to humanity, and it starts near the\nbeginning of the journey.\nThe opening phase establishes the transformation itself. The\nmetamorphosis is usually the result of a curse of some sort.\nOften the protagonist doesn\u0027t initially understand what\u0027s\nhappened to him.\nThe middle story concentrates on the struggle to return to\nhuman form. The opposition to that return is the antagonist,\nwho is also a force for change, destroying the status quo of\nthe curse (otherwise the changeling might stay transformed.)\nAt the story opening the protagonist and antagonist are far\napart, but in the middle story they move toward one another.\nWhether the changeling returns to human form or is destroyed,\npart of the story is the increased understanding of his\ntransformation.\nThe resolution either shows the changeling returned to his\noriginal state or killed."
