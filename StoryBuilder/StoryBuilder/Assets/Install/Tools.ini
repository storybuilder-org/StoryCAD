[MasterPlots]

MasterPlot=Three Act Play
Remarks=The oldest plot pattern, from Aristotle. The plot
Remarks=consists of three movements, or acts. The first
Remarks=act, or setup, presents us with a problem that
Remarks=must be solved. The second act, or rising action,
Remarks=presents obstacles as the protagonist tries to
Remarks=solve the problem. The third act contains the logical
Remarks=outcome of the events in the first two acts. Most stories
Remarks=can be cast as a Three Act Play, and most of the other Masterplots
Remarks=are embellishments of Aristotle's idea of plot structure.
Scene=Three Act Play
Notes=   An act is a dramatic unit consisting of a number of scenes.
Notes=On the stage acts may be separated by a curtain fall; TV show
Notes=acts often end with a commercial or station break.
Notes=  The acts in Three Act Play are also dramatic units comprised of
Notes=scenes, but the acts are logical, rather than physical, groupings.
Notes=  The first act sets up the problem to be solved. The second act, the
Notes=rising action, has the protagonist seek to solve his problem and
Notes=achieve his goal, but he runs into obstacles, or reversals.
Notes=These problems add dramatic tension. The third and final act
Notes=resolves the problem from the first act.
Scene=Act I - Setup
Scene= Narrative hook
Notes=   It's important to capture the reader's interest at the
Notes=beginning of the story sufficiently to keep him reading
Notes=until the story itself- the protagonist and the problem-
Notes=have engaged his attention. The opening paragraphs of
Notes=the story must serve as an advertisement that it's worth reading.
Scene= Introduce Characters
Notes=   Be careful to introduce only the major characters
Notes=(protagonist, antagonist, love interest, etc.)
Notes=in the opening scenes. Readers are familiar with
Notes=this, and will expect any character introduced early
Notes=to be significant.
Scene= Present Problem to be Solved
Notes=   The first act should conclude with the protagonist's
Notes=goal clearly before her and with her committed
Notes=to obtaining it.
Scene=Act II -  Rising Action
Notes=   The second act is, simply, the middle part which
Notes=connects Act I (the question) with Act III (the
Notes=answer.)  If the story problem is too easily
Notes=solved,  there's nothing to entertain the reader.
Notes=Therefore the rising action consists of one or
Notes=more obstacles which prevent the protagonist from
Notes=obtaining his story goal. Providing the obstacle is the
Notes=the job of the antagonist. The number of obstacles depends on
Notes=the story form.
Scene= First Obstacle
Notes=   Every obstacle contains two parts. First, the protagonist pursues
Notes=his story goal. He devises a plan and takes action which will
Notes=move him toward that goal. If there has been a previous obstacle,
Notes=the protagonist's immediate goal may be to respond to it, but
Notes=he works toward the ultimate goal. Second, an obstacle or reversal
Notes=usually happens to thwart the goal. If the protagonist's immediate
Notes=step ends in success, it's only temporary; in Act II he must
Notes=always end up further from his goal than ever.
Scene= Subsequent Obstacles
Notes=   (See notes for First Obstacle)
Scene= Turning Point
Notes=   The reversals may cause an emotional change in the characters.
Notes=This change is the recognition that things have gone
Notes=too far to ever go back to the way they were before the story.
Notes=The story has forever changed the characters or their relationships.
Notes=This recognition usually occurs at the end of the second act,
Notes=just before the climax.
Scene=Act III - Climax and Conclusion
Scene= Climax
Notes=   This is the point in which the story problem is solved, one
Notes=way or another. Either the protagonist succeeds in obtaining her
Notes=goal, or she fails, or she decides that the goal isn't worth obtaining
Notes=any more, or she discovers something that changes the situation- usually
Notes=something about herself. It's important that your protagonist takes
Notes=her fate in her own hands and solve, or try to solve, her own problem.
Notes=Having the calvary ride up at the last minute is no longer acceptable.
Scene= Denouement
Notes=   'Denouement' is from the French for 'an untying'. In the denouement,
Notes=all of the knotty problems posed by the story are unravelled. Any
Notes=remaining mysteries are answered, any remaining complications solved,
Notes=so that things are neatly wrapped up. This plot point may be omitted
Notes=in many stories, depending on your preferences.

MasterPlot=Seven Point Story Structure
Remarks=Dan Wells is a bestselling author and game developer. His
Remarks=popular 'seven point' plot method is described on a series
Remarks=of YouTube videos and blog posts and has been widely
Remarks=reposted and referenced on the web.
Remarks=The numbers in the plot points are the suggested order in
Remarks=which the scenes should be outlined.
Scene=Ice Monster (8)
Notes=An optional prolog, since the Hook is often a point of weakness.
Notes=It's used before the conflict is introduced, to grab your
Notes=Reader's attention.
Scene=Hook (2)
Notes=The starting state. This to Resolution forces an arc.
Notes=It's the equilibrium that needs upset.
Scene=Plot Turn I (4)
Notes=Move from the hook to Midpoint.
Notes=Introduce the conflict.
Notes=New people, new secrets.
Notes=Follow the white rabbit.
Notes=Call to adventure.
Scene=Pinch I (5)
Notes=Apply pessure.
Notes=Something goes wrong.
Notes=Peace is destroyed.
Notes=Bad guys attack.
Notes=Introduce the villain.
Scene=Midpoint (3)
Notes=Protagonist moves from reaction to action.
Notes=This is the Mirror Moment- character is forced to look at himself.
Scene=Pinch II (6)
Notes=Apply more pressure, until the situation seems hopeless.
Notes=The bad guys seem to win.
Notes=These are the jaws of defeat from which your hero snatches victory.
Notes=Make sure the teeth are sharp.
Scene=Plot Turn II (7)
Notes=Move the story from midpoint to the end.
Notes=You optain the thing you need to win- even if you don't realize it.
Notes='The power is in you.'
Scene=Resolution (1)
Notes=Not the falling action, but the climax.
Notes=A disaster/bad ending for many middle story problems.
Notes=Or a solution may lead to a subsequent problem.
Notes=The major story problem resolution ends story.

MasterPlot=W-Diagram
Remarks=This version of the W-Diagram is taught by Janice Bennet in her
Remarks=writing workshops. See Kubis & Howland in the bibliography for more
Remarks=information. Picture a letter W. The plot points in this masterplot are
Remarks=the vertices and edges of the 'W', starting with the top left.
Remarks=The edges or legs represent rising or falling dramatic tension;
Remarks=the two low vertices are the places where things are worse for
Remarks=for the protagonist. Every point except for the two end points
Remarks=is a 'turning point' in the plot. A longer story form can have
Remarks=multiple W-diagrams. For a tragedy, invert the diagram to make an 'M'.
Scene=Recognition of Goal (A)
Notes=  A strong character finds herself in a bad situation with a
Notes=worthwhile goal and a good reason for achieving it.
Scene=Initial Barrier (B)
Notes=  The protagonist encounters a major obstacle.
Scene=Low Point (C)
Notes=  This is the protagonist's initial reaction to the barrier,
Notes=and an emotional low point.
Scene=Barrier Reversal (D)
Notes=  The protagonist overcomes the initial barrier by his or her
Notes=own actions.
Scene=High Point (E)
Notes=  The protagonist nearly reaches the goal.
Scene=Rug Pull (F)
Notes=  A disaster, major reversal or much greater obstacle arises and
Notes=stands between the protagonist and the goal. This is often
Notes=related to a flaw in the protagonist.
Scene=Catastrophe (G)
Notes=  All seems lost.
Scene=Struggle (H)
Notes=  The protagonist overcomes the second obstacle, growing in
Notes=the process.
Scene=Achievement of Goal (I)
Notes=  The protagonist achieves the goal, using what he's learned from,
Notes=or based on how he's changed from, the story events.

MasterPlot=Hero's Journey
Remarks=The Hero's Journey is described in Joseph Campbell's
Remarks='The Hero with a Thousand Faces.' It's a distillation of the
Remarks=hero legend as it occurs through the ages in many cultures.
Remarks=The Hero's Journey taps into the deep roots of storytelling.
Remarks=In this Masterplot, every story is a quest, whether an outward
Remarks=journey or an inward one. The stages of the journey are a
Remarks=framework to the inward growth and understanding that mirrors
Remarks=the journey itself. This dual quest is the basis of the deep
Remarks=symbolism and the universal appeal of these story elements.
Remarks=The stages of the Journey can be used in any story, and
Remarks=can be combined with any other masterplot.
Scene=Ordinary World
Notes=  This plot point shows the protagonist in his customary,
Notes=normal environment, before he is thrust into the special
Notes=and alien environment of the story.
Scene=Call to Adventure
Notes=  The protagonist is presented with his goal: a problem to
Notes=solve, an adventure to take, or a challenge to rise to.
Scene=Refusal of the Call
Notes=  The protagonist shows reluctance or fear  to begin the
Notes=the journey. This is largely fear of unknown.
Scene=Mentor
Notes=  The protagonist allies with a wise and trusted advisor or
Notes=teacher. The mentor's role is to prepare the protagonist
Notes=for the journey. However, the protagonist must eventually
Notes=face the challenge alone.
Scene=First Threshold
Notes=  The protagonist is now committed to the journey. In Quest
Notes=stories this is the start of the travels; in other stories
Notes=the First Threshold may be an act of challenge or defiance.
Scene=Tests, Allies, and Enemies
Notes=These are the beginning of the middle story (Act II in the
Notes=Three Act Play.)  The protagonist's courage and determination
Notes=are tested in a series of confrontations. These tests allow
Notes=the protagonist to grow, learn, and acquire information.
Scene=Approach to the Inmost Cave
Notes=  The protagonist approaches the place where the object of the
Notes=quest is hidden. This is dangerous ground, often the territory
Notes=of the antagonist. To approach the goal, the protagonist must
Notes=overcome the obstacles of this second major threshold.
Scene=Supreme Ordeal
Notes=  The protagonist directly confronts his greatest fear.
Notes=Here he may loose his life or his soul, and the outcome
Notes=is in the balance.
Scene=Seizing the Reward
Notes=  The protagonist takes possession of the goal he has sought.
Notes=The reward may be an object, some knowledge, or the end of
Notes=a conflict with someone (as with romances.)
Scene=The Road Back
Notes=  This is the beginning of Act II in the Three Act Play. The
Notes=action isn't over yet; the forces the protagonist confronted
Notes=in the Supreme Ordeal may rise again and pursue him.
Notes=The protagonist begins his attempt to return to the Ordinary
Notes=World.
Scene=Resurrection
Notes=  This is the second major test of the protagonist, often
Notes=almost a replay of the Supreme Ordeal. It represents a
Notes=moment of renewal, which wins the protagonist new power, or
Notes=which proves his growth as a result of what when before.
Scene=Return With The Elixir
Notes=  The protagonist returns to the Ordinary World. A new equilibrium
Notes=is restored, but things are different than they were at the start
Notes=of the story, because the protagonist has brought back some
Notes=treasure or knowledge from the journey.

MasterPlot=Adventure
Remarks=The Adventure story is similar to the Quest, but instead of
Remarks=focusing on the person making the journey, the focus is
Remarks=on the journey itself. Adventure stories should be full of
Remarks=of strange settings, characters, and situations- of
Remarks=vicarious thrills. Adventure is never found at home, or
Remarks=if it is, home turns out to be a stranger place than first imagined.
Remarks=The protagonist must seek adventure, or accept it when it's
Remarks=thrust upon him. Character growth is not key to this masterplot;
Remarks=what's important is what happens next.
Scene=Adventure
Notes=  Adventures start with the protagonist leaving the normal world
Notes=of his home because of some motivating incident. This should
Notes=happen quickly.
Notes=  The story question is usually simple: Will she find a husband?
Notes=Will he find his missing father?  Often adventure stories
Notes=will include elements of romance- which is always an adventure.
Notes=  The adventures that make up an adventure story are the
Notes=complications of the middle story. It's essential to move
Notes=around a lot in these tales, but each incident must still
Notes=be plausible and follow from the previous one.
Notes=  The complications must be complications, and not just
Notes=postcards from far-away places. The protagonist's goal should
Notes=still drive the plot.
Notes=  Research is important in adventure plots; the more exotic
Notes=the locales and people encountered, the more the need to
Notes=look and sound authentic.
Notes=  The resolution phase must answer the story question posed
Notes=in the opening. But just as the story problem itself is often
Notes=uncomplicated, so is there no need for complicated resolutions.
Notes=In adventure stories, it's the journey itself that's important.

MasterPlot=Ascent/Descent
Remarks=These are stories of the protagonist's rise to power.
Remarks=They're character based, and
Remarks=the protagonist must be larger than life. She is at odds
Remarks=with her environment, and wants to change it. Character
Remarks=traits such as ambition drive these stories.
Remarks=Ascent may also lead to Descent, unless the protagonist
Remarks=grows and changes.
Scene=Ascension
Notes=The force which drives the protagonist, such as ego or ambition,
Notes=molds the events of the story: nothing and no one can stand in
Notes=her way. But achieving her external goals is not enough; if
Notes=the protagonist doesn't tame her demons, they will overwhelm
Notes=her.
Scene=Descent
Notes=The forces which motivate the protagonist, such as ego, ambition,
Notes=or aggression, aren't changed by character growth and development.
Notes=They ultimately serve as the protagonist's undoing. These are
Notes=tragedies, stories with unhappy endings. The protagonist is
Notes=either lost, or evil, but either way, comes to a bad end.
Notes=The failure is at the moment of crisis.
Scene=Rise and Fall
Notes=The story may combine both Ascension and Descent. The
Notes=protagonist's drive and determination seemingly give her
Notes=the goals she seeks, but the very traits which put her goals
Notes=in her grasp also lead to her destruction, because unless
Notes=they're controlled, the continue to burn.

MasterPlot=Discovery
Remarks=The Discovery story is character based, and centers on a person's
Remarks=need to understand herself. Typically events force a change
Remarks=upon the protagonist, whose attempts to return to the old self.
Remarks=When the attempts fail, she undergoes a revelation and achieves
Remarks=greater self awareness.
Scene=Discovery
Notes=  These are character-driven plots, and the protagonist must learn
Notes=something about himself, about who he is and what matters to him.
Notes=This is a common plot in children's literature; all coming-of-age
Notes=stories are Discovery plots.
Notes=  In Discovery stories, it's important to allow the reader to
Notes=discover for himself what it is the protagonist has learned.
Notes=Avoid the urge to preach.
Notes=  Often the protagonist doesn't want to make the discovery.
Notes=He may think his life is fine the way it is, or the discovery
Notes=may be a painful one (often Discovery means facing something we've
Notes=known all along.)
Notes=  The opening story shows the protagonist prior to the
Notes=discovery, but sets the forces in motion which lead to it.
Notes=  In the middle story the protagonist is forced to confront the
Notes=thing about himself that he needs to learn.
Notes=  The final act begins with his learning the lesson. The
Notes=conclusion may either show that he's made the discovery
Notes=by some token action, or suggest his resolve to act
Notes=differently (based on what he's learned) in the future.

MasterPlot=Escape
Remarks=The protagonist is literally trapped, and wants out. Escape is similar
Remarks=to the Rescue masterplot, but in this plot the victim is the
Remarks=center of the action, and works
Remarks=to free himself. Often (but not always) the victim is unfairly
Remarks=imprisoned. Justly punished or not, the focus of Escape is on the
Remarks=escape attempt itself.
Scene=Escape
Notes=  Escape plots differ from rescue plots largely in viewpoint;
Notes=the victim perpetrates his own escape, rather than waiting to
Notes=to be rescued. As such, he's the protagonist.
Notes=  The opening establishes the need for escape, by showing the
Notes=imprisonment. The victim may be guilty or innocent, but if he's
Notes=guilty, either the imprisonment will be shown to be
Notes=unjustly harsh, or the story will be a test of wills between
Notes=a strong jailor and the equally strong prisoner. The story
Notes=question is simple: will he escape?
Notes=  If there is an attempt to escape in the opening phase, it's
Notes=feeble and is either thwarted or the victim's easily recaptured.
Notes=Escape should be shown to not be easy.
Notes=  The middle story deals with planning to escape. The
Notes=complications are things which thwart these plans.
Notes=  The resolution phase is the escape itself. Normally the plans
Notes=from the second phase fall apart, and things are out of control.
Notes=This is the most physically active phase of the story.

MasterPlot=Forbidden Love
Remarks=Love is a powerful emotion, but not all love is acceptable to society.
Remarks=When lovers are confronted with social strictures for the
Remarks=sake of their love, strong stories can result. The story may
Remarks=reinforce the taboos as to when and where love is proper. Most
Remarks=impossible loves end in tragedy. Or the story may show that love
Remarks=can overcome any obstacle.
Remarks=Forbidden love can center around any unconventional behavior,
Remarks=with adultery the most common example.
Scene=Forbidden Love
Notes=  The forbidden love may be a case of adultery, a homosexual
Notes=affair, incest, age differences or some other type of proscribed
Notes=romance. In any case, there must be some social force against
Notes=the liaison. The lovers must ignore this social pressure.
Notes=  The opening phase defines the forbidden relationship
Notes=as to what law or convention is violated, and how the various
Notes=parties- the lovers and those around them- react to the outrage.
Notes=  The middle story focuses on the results of breaking convention.
Notes=Social forces exert pressure on the lovers and cause problems
Notes=for them which may start to break them apart. The complications
Notes=must stem directly from the love affair.
Notes=  The ending takes the affair to its conclusion. Many of the
Notes=endings are unhappy, with the lovers separated, dead, or
Notes=abandoned.

MasterPlot=Love
Remarks=True love is hard to find, and harder to hold on to.
Remarks=The obstacles which
Remarks=can keep lovers apart are the grist for this masterplot's mill.
Remarks=The obstacle may be some incompatibility between the lovers,
Remarks=a misunderstanding or situation that keeps them from consummating
Remarks=their affair, or it may be a rival suitor. Although the obstacles
Remarks=to love are the essence of the plot, the real key to Love stories
Remarks=is the lovers; the chemistry must be right.
Remarks=Not all Love stories have happy endings.
Scene=Love
Notes=  Unlike Forbidden Love, the lovers in a love plot will normally
Notes=have a happy ending. But complications must stand between them,
Notes=and it must take dedication and perseverance to come to that
Notes=happy ending.
Notes=  The characters of the lovers should be defined to provide
Notes=some built-in conflict. They might be from different sides of
Notes=the tracks, have different external goals, be physically
Notes=different, have differing degrees of education, come from
Notes=different cultural groups, etc.
Notes=  Normally one of the characters will be more aggressive about
Notes=the romance, and the other more passive. The role of aggressor
Notes=can change in  mid-romance.
Notes=  The middle story consists of the obstacles to love. There
Notes=are only so many of these, so the characters themselves, and
Notes=the emotions themselves, are more important, and must be
Notes=stressed.
Notes=  The ending depends on the characters. If they are worthy,
Notes=and have endured the obstacles to romance well enough, they
Notes=should persevere. But a happy ending forced on the wrong
Notes=characters won't work.

MasterPlot=Metamorphosis
Remarks=Metamorphosis is a change in form or appearance. The change is
Remarks=from animal or monster to human, or vice versa,
Remarks=usually as a result of a curse. Metamorphosis connects
Remarks=us with the animal side of our natures, and
Remarks=with the multidimensional side of our personalities. The changeling
Remarks=seeks to be whole and human; the cure is usually love.
Scene=Metamorphosis
Notes=  The changeling is usually the protagonist. His story is the
Notes=attempt to change back to human form, and the story question
Notes=is whether or not he will succeed. If the transformation is
Notes=caused by evil, the protagonist must have a chance at redemption.
Notes=  If the changeling is cast as the antagonist, there's little
Notes=chance of redemption, but the curse may be ended by his death
Notes=(which he may long for.)
Notes=The story question is then whether or not he will be defeated
Notes=and destroyed.
Notes=  The story is largely concerned with the nature of the metamorph,
Notes=with his character. The transformation is symbolic, and
Notes=what he changes into is important for what it represents.
Notes=  The transformation may have taken place earlier, but the story is
Notes=about the journey back to humanity, and it starts near the
Notes=beginning of the journey.
Notes=  The opening phase establishes the transformation itself. The
Notes=metamorphosis is usually the result of a curse of some sort.
Notes=Often the protagonist doesn't initially understand what's
Notes=happened to him.
Notes=  The middle story concentrates on the struggle to return to
Notes=human form. The opposition to that return is the antagonist,
Notes=who is also a force for change, destroying the status quo of
Notes=the curse (otherwise the changeling might stay transformed.)
Notes=  At the story opening the protagonist and antagonist are far
Notes=apart, but in the middle story they move toward one another.
Notes=Whether the changeling returns to human form or is destroyed,
Notes=part of the story is the increased understanding of his
Notes=transformation.
Notes=  The resolution either shows the changeling returned to his
Notes=original state or killed.

MasterPlot=Quest
Remarks=The Quest plot is the protagonist's search
Remarks=for an object. It may be a person,
Remarks=a place (Shangrila), or a tangible
Remarks=or intangible thing (gold, immortality.)
Remarks=The object of the search is perceived
Remarks=by the protagonist as vitally important.
Remarks=He is shaped by the quest and his success or
Remarks=failure in obtaining the object.
Scene=Quest
Notes=   The quest plot begins by showing the start of the odyssey.
Notes=The journey usually begins at home, and the story's
Notes=opening shows the protagonist at home.
Notes=An event, or some inner longing, compels the protagonist to action.
Notes=   But those first tentative steps, aren't enough.
Notes=The protagonist must be irrevocably committed to the quest.
Notes=The first incident on the quest should serve to remove all choices
Notes=about going back. Any doubts are eliminated. At the beginning,
Notes=the protagonist may have had only a vague notion of what he
Notes=wants to do. This first incident will give him a specific idea of
Notes=what he wants to accomplish. The character's initial motivation
Notes=should now be even stronger.
Notes=   The protagonist may receive assistance in the form of travelling
Notes=companions or a character offering support and guidance- a mentor.
Notes=Both of these types of allies are usually brought into the story
Notes=late in the first act.
Notes=   The hero must be shown to be worthy of winning the goal. Only
Notes=serious hurdles will test your protagonist sufficiently to change him,
Notes=and in a quest plot, the protagonist must change for the better or worse.
Notes=All quests are ultimately inner journeys, and the new awareness must be
Notes=born in him as a result of the conflict.
Notes=    As with Adventure plots, the quest contains built-in movement.
Notes=The heroine must go after the prize she seeks; it won't come to
Notes=her. This offers opportunities for a wide range of settings.
Notes=The protagonist should move freely, and the middle story is where
Notes=this movement is played out.
Notes=   There are three possible outcomes for quests: the protagonist
Notes=achieves his goal, he fails to achieve it, or he abandons the
Notes=quest. But since the Quest is really an inner journey, the
Notes=outcome must stem from the change which occurs in the protagonist's
Notes=nature as a result of the journey.

MasterPlot=Pursuit
Remarks=There is nothing complicated about Pursuit. The pursuer chases
Remarks=the pursued. All that's needed to get this plot rolling are
Remarks=these two character roles, the reason for
Remarks=the pursuit, and something at stake.
Remarks=The good guy can chase the
Remarks=bad, or vice versa. The stakes should be suitably high.
Remarks=Most horror stories are based upon
Remarks=Pursuit. The story can be told from either perspective,
Remarks=the pursuer or the one being chased. The plot depends
Remarks=heavily on physical action.
Scene=Pursuit
Notes=    The opening establishes who's chasing who, which one is
Notes=the protagonist, and what's at stake if caught (prison, death,
Notes=etc.)  As always, the contest should be balanced, so there's
Notes=a real chance of either escape or getting caught. Some motivating
Notes=incident gets the chase started.
Notes=    The middle story is the chase itself. Complications, setbacks,
Notes=and reversals are the essence of the chase story. Pursuit
Notes=plots rely on quick action and lots of it. The action must be
Notes=unpredictable and keep the audience off balance. Confine the
Notes=characters to limited territory, such as a ship, a building,
Notes=or a train, to cut off escape routes and heighten tension.
Notes=   The ending resolves the pursuit in one of two ways: capture
Notes=or escape and freedom.

MasterPlot=Rescue
Remarks=Rescue requires three roles: the rescuer (who is the protagonist),
Remarks=the victim, and the antagonist. Rescue is based upon action rather
Remarks=than the characters themselves; it's the roles that matter. The focus
Remarks=is on the protagonist's rescue attempt, and the villain's efforts to
Remarks=foil it.
Scene=Rescue
Notes=  The common motivation for the rescuer is love for the victim.
Notes=The story line follows the hero in pursuit of the villain. This
Notes=frequently takes him to unfamiliar places, such as the villain's
Notes=lair.
Notes=  The opening deals with the issue of separation. The victim
Notes=is abducted or placed in jeopardy. The rescuer learns of the
Notes=situation and makes pans for pursuit.
Notes=   The middle story is the pursuit itself. As with pursuit
Notes=stories, the goal is to put as many unsuspected twists and
Notes=obstacles in the way of the rescuer as possible. This is the
Notes=villain's role.
Notes=   The resolution phase involves confrontation between the
Notes=rescuer and the antagonist. This is followed by the reunion
Notes=of the rescuer with the victim.

MasterPlot=Revenge
Remarks=The Revenge masterplot is about a protagonist who
Remarks=is forced to take matters into his own hands when
Remarks=the law doesn't punish a transgression. The nature of
Remarks=the victim and the crime must make us
Remarks=cry for rough justice. The story proceeds as
Remarks=the protagonist attempts to extract retribution equal to
Remarks=the offense.
Scene=Revenge
Notes=  Revenge plots deal not only with the revenge itself, but with
Notes=the protagonist's motives for revenge.
Notes=  The story opens with an outrage, real or imagined. Normal forms
Notes=of recourse, such as the law, must be shown as ineffective. The
Notes=protagonist has to take matters in his own hands, but the
Notes=regular channels should be given a chance first.
Notes=  The middle story has the protagonist making plans and pursuing
Notes=the antagonist. If there is only one antagonist, the plans
Notes=and chase get the focus. If the antagonist is powerful and has
Notes=allies or henchmen, the protagonist may confront them on his
Notes=way to the final confrontation with the antagonist.
Notes=  The resolution has the protagonist either abandoning his revenge,
Notes=or taking it. In the later case the antagonist should be shown
Notes=as still worth taking revenge against. The hero's actions should
Notes=equal, but not exceed, the offense: an eye for an eye.

MasterPlot=Mystery
Remarks=The Mystery revolves around a problem that needs a solution. The
Remarks=reader is challenged to solve the puzzle. The
Remarks=events of the story serve two purposes; they move the story
Remarks=along, but they also are clues which must be interpreted
Remarks=to help to solve the mystery. The Mystery story succeeds
Remarks=when it gives the reader a fair chance to find the solution,
Remarks=but fails when the clues are too obvious or the answer is too
Remarks=easy to unearth. Mystery is a game, and you must play
Remarks=by the rules. In this masterplot, the every event must have a reason,
Remarks=every effect, a cause.
Scene=Mystery
Notes=    Because the mystery story is largely a challenge to the
Notes=Reader to solve the problem, the heart of the story is the
Notes=problem: it must be a puzzle, whose solution is not obvious. As
Notes=the protagonist struggles to solve the problem, so should the
Notes=audience.
Notes=    It's necessary to play fairly with the readers; they must
Notes=be given a fair chance to solve the mystery. This means that
Notes=the story must contain clues which allow the solution. It's
Notes=all right to misdirect the protagonist and reader, with false
Notes=trails and ambiguous clues, but the solution must be in sight,
Notes=and you must play fairly.
Notes=   The protagonist is the reader's agent in these stories; he
Notes=must ask the questions that the reader needs asked in order
Notes=to solicit the clues. The protagonist is therefore usually
Notes=observant and thoughtful.
Notes=  The opening phase must present the mystery to be solved.
Notes=The protagonist's motive for solving the crime should also
Notes=be presented. Many mysteries open with the crime itself.
Notes=   The middle story consists of searching for clues. The
Notes=clues should not be too obvious; the perfect clue is like
Notes=the purloined letter in Poe's story:  there all the time, in
Notes=plain sight.
Notes=   The resolution involves solving the riddle. The answer must
Notes=fit the clues, and explain things. Often solving the riddle
Notes=can segue into a more physical plot, such as a chase or pursuit.
Notes=But the action is secondary to the mystery.

MasterPlot=Rivalry
Remarks=Rivalry exists whenever adversaries compete for the same
Remarks=goal, be it wealth, love, or power. The
Remarks=outcome must be in doubt, so the adversaries should be
Remarks=evenly matched; if they're not, it's
Remarks=the Underdog plot. While the story may be of conflict
Remarks=between good and evil, it may equally
Remarks=be between two worthy characters. Whatever the goal,
Remarks=the struggle itself is the heart of Rivalry.
Scene=Rivalry
Notes=  The opening phase establishes the protagonist and antagonist
Notes=as two equally powerful characters, who are after the same goal.
Notes=Each character's relative weakness must be offset by a corresponding
Notes=strength: if one is faster, the other should be smarter.
Notes=The motives of the rivalry should also be revealed.
Notes=  The middles story is the clash of equal forces. The contest
Notes=should very much be in doubt, with first one side getting the
Notes=upper hand, then the other. Frequently the clash of wills
Notes=leads to disadvantage for the protagonist, who slowly climbs
Notes=back to a position of roughly equal power before the climax.
Notes=  The resolution is determined by the relative moral positions
Notes=of the characters. The antagonist will often cross the line
Notes=into immoral or reprehensible conduct during the middle story;
Notes=that point determines the winner.
Notes=  The resolution is the final confrontation between the two
Notes=rivals.

MasterPlot=Sacrifice
Remarks=Sacrifice stories are based upon something we instinctively
Remarks=know is true: things of great value
Remarks=are obtained only at great price. The thing of value
Remarks=may be love, honor, or the greater good
Remarks=of mankind. The price may be life, or the giving up
Remarks=of a cherished belief or value, but whatever
Remarks=is sacrificed, it must matter greatly to the protagonist.
Remarks=In Sacrifice stories the protagonist
Remarks=must have a choice, an easy way out or the difficult
Remarks=sacrifice. The story centers around this choice
Remarks=and explores the protagonist's character under stress.
Scene=Sacrifice
Notes=  The sacrifice story explores the character who makes the sacrifice.
Notes=As such this is a 'plot of the head', and the character is more
Notes=important than the action.
Notes=  The story opening should show the protagonist as unlikely to
Notes=to make the sacrifice; the sacrifice is ultimately a result
Notes=of character growth during the story. If the decision is too
Notes=easy there's no story. At the same time, the protagonist must
Notes=contain traits that make the sacrifice believable. This often
Notes=requires back story to explain the inner conflict.
Notes=  The opening presents the two sides of the sacrifice as having
Notes=great meaning to the protagonist. The price of the sacrifice
Notes=must be high, but the value of the thing sacrificed for must
Notes=also be high.
Notes=  The middle story must present the protagonist with a complication
Notes=which makes the choice, but not the outcome, inevitable. There
Notes=should be no easy way out of the dilemma: either the protagonist
Notes=avoids the sacrifice, but looses the prize, or makes the sacrifice,
Notes=and pays for it.
Notes=  The resolution focuses on the sacrifice itself, but, more
Notes=importantly, on the cost of the sacrifice. The climax should
Notes=hang in the balance. But once the choice is made, the story
Notes=turns its attention to what the result of the sacrifice is.
Notes=Show whether the sacrifice has the desired effect, and show
Notes=how the affects the protagonist (the cost.)

MasterPlot=Temptation
Remarks=Temptation is conflict: the devil on one shoulder
Remarks=battling the angel on the other. This
Remarks=character-based masterplot tells the story of the
Remarks=price of yielding to temptation. Although the
Remarks=antagonist/tempter may appear to be another person,
Remarks=the real adversary is the protagonist's bad side,
Remarks=the part that yields to temptation. The story's
Remarks=resolution stems from the protagonist's guilt, anger,
Remarks=or remorse over giving in, and ends in atonement and forgiveness.
Scene=Temptation
Notes=  In a temptation plot the antagonist can be either the
Notes=protagonist himself (man against man), or can be external. If
Notes=external, the antagonist/tempter is a symbol; the struggle is
Notes=still within the protagonist, of good vs. evil, right vs. wrong.
Notes=  The opening should present the protagonist and his proposed
Notes=transgression. What is the temptation he may give into?  What
Notes=are its rewards?  What's the cost of yielding to temptation?
Notes=The story question is 'will the protagonist yield to temptation?'
Notes=Presenting the story problem is presenting the two sides of
Notes=the choice.
Notes=  The middle story will begin when the protagonist yields to the
Notes=temptation. You may want to show the sweet side of giving in,
Notes=but it's only temporary satisfaction.
Notes=  Temptation as sin (error) presents itself. The sweet side
Notes=turns bitter, and the costly nature of the decision begins
Notes=to be evident. This is the major complication. The protagonist
Notes=will try to deny and evade the punishment (further complications),
Notes=but to no avail.
Notes=  The resolution has two possible outcomes. The negative
Notes=outcome is tragic; the protagonist can't confess her sin, and
Notes=the punishment is final. The positive outcome has the
Notes=protagonist, at the climax, confess and ask forgiveness. The
Notes=result is the happy ending: the forgiveness is granted, and
Notes=joy is restored.

MasterPlot=Transformation
Remarks=In Transformation, the protagonist undergoes change,
Remarks=and is a different person at the end of the story than at
Remarks=she was at the beginning. The change may be from
Remarks=one stage of development to another, such as 'coming
Remarks=of age' stories. The change may begin with a
Remarks=transforming experience such
Remarks=as a religious conversion, war, the death of a
Remarks=loved one, or the birth of a child. Or it may come from
Remarks=the protagonist being made aware of some aspect of
Remarks=her personality or background which is unexpected and
Remarks=unwanted. Transformation stories end with the protagonist learning
Remarks=the lesson of the change, or with an incident which
Remarks=shows the complete transformation.
Scene=Transformation
Notes=  The transformation masterplot is a 'plot of the head', stressing
Notes=character rather than action.
Notes=  The inciting incident is the key to the transformation plot's
Notes=opening phase. The incident should be big enough to start a
Notes=life-changing process in the protagonist:  the emergence from
Notes=childhood to adulthood, the death of a loved one, war, etc.
Notes=  The first act ends as the transforming incident begins to
Notes=work on the character of the protagonist and cause change.
Notes=  The middle story shows the transformation affecting the
Notes=protagonist's perceptions. This often requires self-examination
Notes=and inward turning, so close viewpoints are normal for these
Notes=stories.
Notes=  The resolution clarifies the change that the initial incident
Notes=started. This usually requires another external event, to
Notes=which the protagonist can react to show how he's changed. In
Notes=many stories, the 'lesson' of this final reaction is different
Notes=than the initial transformation suggests.

MasterPlot=Underdog
Remarks=This plot is similar to Rivalry. But in Rivalry the
Remarks=two adversaries are evenly pitted (it's a fair contest.)
Remarks=There's nothing fair about Underdog stories. The
Remarks=protagonist faces a seemingly unstoppable opponent. These plots
Remarks=attract readers and viewers because we are all
Remarks=underdogs at one time or another, and have faced
Remarks=overpowering circumstances.
Remarks=The Underdog hero is us, working out our fantasies.
Scene=Underdog
Notes=  In many underdog stories, the antagonist is society or the
Notes=situation or nature- some juggernaut of opposing force.
Notes=  The protagonist should be a simple character, and is often
Notes=less intelligent or more humble than the intended audience.
Notes=His strength is his tenacity and willingness to struggle.
Notes=  The opening should put the protagonist at a disadvantage. Show
Notes=him loosing power and being oppressed or suppressed by the
Notes=antagonist. The opening act should end by resistance, however,
Notes=with the protagonist initiating some action to prevail.
Notes=  The middle story begins with the outcome of the protagonist
Notes=first effort to assert himself. At first it may appear to
Notes=succeed, but the gain is offset by a setback. Subsequent
Notes=attempts to gain the upper hand also fail. But after each
Notes=failure the protagonist tries again.
Notes=  The resolution begins with the protagonist approaching a
Notes=parity with the antagonist, so that for the first time, the
Notes=outcome is in doubt. The protagonist now actively confronts
Notes=the antagonist in a showdown.

MasterPlot=Immoderation
Remarks=This plot deals with a flawed but sympathetic person
Remarks=who's been pushed to the edge, either by madness or
Remarks=by events. Placed under
Remarks=extreme circumstances, the wild animal which is
Remarks=inside each of us emerges, and the decline to  the
Remarks=pit begins. The story can
Remarks=end on an upbeat note, with the protagonist moving
Remarks=back toward normalcy, or in tragedy.
Scene=Immoderation
Notes=  The immoderation plot starts with a flawed trait in the
Notes=character of the protagonist. The character defect is what leads
Notes=him to immoderation. This is a 'plot of the head', and the
Notes=character development is especially important.
Notes=  The opening shows the character before the decline, in order
Notes=to showcase the changes. The 'inciting incident' is may be
Notes=a circumstance which forces the character to act differently.
Notes=  The middle story shows the decline itself. The decline
Notes=traces the ascendancy of the flawed trait over other aspects
Notes=of the character. The loss of control should be gradual.
Notes=  Focus on the emotions, but also keep the
Notes=protagonist as sympathetic as possible. His decline has to be
Notes=felt as tragedy.
Notes=  The third act begins at the point where the protagonist has
Notes=lost control, and things can't get worse. There are two
Notes=possible outcomes. The protagonist must either move toward
Notes=recovery and redemption, or must be utterly destroyed.
Notes=  A 'precipitating incident' may be the pivot on which the
Notes=resolution changes. If the protagonist moves toward
Notes=redemption, this is a 'came to realize' event, and the incident
Notes=shows the character how far he's declined. If the ending
Notes=is tragic, the protagonist should take some unrecoverable
Notes=action such as murder or suicide.
