StoryCAD Additional Permissions v1.0
(Additional permissions under GNU GPL version 3, section 7)

This document grants additional permissions that supplement the GNU GPLv3
for the following software (the “Program”):
- StoryCAD
- StoryCADLib

1) Proprietary “Collaborator” module linking permission

As a special exception, you have permission to link, load, or otherwise
combine the Program with the independent proprietary module known as
“Collaborator” (the “Collaborator Module”), including when the Collaborator
Module consumes StoryCADLib (for example via a NuGet package reference), and
to convey the resulting combined work under terms of your choice for the
Collaborator Module, provided that all of the following are met:

  a) The Collaborator Module is distributed by, or under a written license
     from, StoryCAD Foundation.

  b) You comply with the GNU GPLv3 for all portions of the Program included
     in the combined work. This includes providing Corresponding Source for
     the Program and preserving all required copyright and license notices.

  c) This exception does not grant any permission to copy, modify, or convey
     the Collaborator Module except as allowed by the Collaborator Module’s
     own license.

  d) This exception does not grant permission to combine the Program with
     any other proprietary module or plug-in.

2) Apple App Store distribution permission for StoryCAD builds

As a special exception, StoryCAD Foundation (and distributors expressly
authorized in writing by StoryCAD Foundation) have permission to convey
compiled object-code builds of StoryCAD through the Apple App Store,
notwithstanding any otherwise-incompatible App Store terms, usage rules, or
technical restrictions (including code signing requirements), provided that
all of the following are met:

  a) The complete Corresponding Source for the exact version of StoryCAD
     distributed via the Apple App Store is made available to the public,
     at no charge, from a publicly accessible network server that is not
     subject to App Store terms or device-based usage limits.

  b) The App Store listing (or in-app “About / Licenses” screen) includes a
     clear notice that StoryCAD is GPLv3-licensed and includes a URL or
     other clear directions to obtain the Corresponding Source.

  c) You comply with the GNU GPLv3 for the Program in all other respects for
     that distribution.

3) General

These additional permissions apply only to the extent they are valid under
applicable law. If you modify the Program, you may extend these additional
permissions to your version, but you are not obligated to do so.

(For clarity: Under GPLv3 section 7, when conveying a copy of a covered work,
a distributor may remove additional permissions from that copy.)
