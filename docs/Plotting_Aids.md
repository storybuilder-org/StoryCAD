Plotting Aids <br/>

The Plotting Aids sub-menu of the Tools menu displays a pull-down sub-menu of tools specific to the process of defining your plot. <br/>

The Master Plots tool will populate your plot outline with a set of plot points according to a template or master plot outline, or will provide information on commonly recurring plot patterns. <br/>

The Dramatic Situations tool uses standard dramatic situations to help you beef up the drama in an existing scene, or to add a scene which relies on a particular dramatic situation. <br/>

The Stock Scenes tool provides lists of scenes frequently found in certain plotting situations, or in a particular genre. <br/>
