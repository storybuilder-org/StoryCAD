### Creating a Story pt 4 ###
Let's shift gears for a moment and think about outer and inner problems.  The section "Outer and Inner Problems" discusses this topic in detail.  

The outer or external problem we've just added has a physical goal--- to catch Charlie Lacas and send him to jail.  External problems focus attention on physical actions and away from your characters.  To balance the story with a measure of character orientation, we'll add an inner problem for our protagonist to overcome.  Let's give Leonard a character flaw to deal with.

Going to the Tools menu, we select Virtues and Vices from the Characterization Aids sub‑ menu and browse through this list of traits until we find one that looks good:

         


Remember, we have no preconceptions about Leonard's character; he's a blank sheet of paper.  He can therefore easily be molded to suit the story, and giving him a character flaw by making him impulsive is a step in that direction.

The Virtues and Vices tool doesn't update our story outline; it's just a list of traits to review.  Clicking DONE on the form, we can save this trait in a number of places: on the Habits tab, on the Role tab, etc., depending on how he manifests this trait. 

Let's look at one choice, the Inner Traits tab:

This list of traits (which can be tailored to suit your needs) is adapted from psychological personality profiles.  It turns out that Impulsiveness is a value under the Adventurousness trait, so we select that value.  We should remember though, that inner traits need to be demonstrated as external actions, under the 'show, don't tell' maxim.  

This new flaw isn't useful until it affects the story outcome.  That is, the inner problem needs to have something to do with the outer problem we created earlier.  Let's add the second problem now.  Recalling that our initial idea mentions rescue, we can let Leonard's impulsive act put him in a situation where he needs rescue:

If Leonard's captured, he needs a rescuer, or at least a diversion; Tony's the obvious choice. 
The story is beginning to take on substance; we can start to visualize some scenes.  In fact, if a plot point occurs to you,  there's no reason not to add it, now or at any time.  Stories are conceived through a process of accumulation, and one of StoryBuilder's strong points is that you can collect whatever pieces fit as you find them.  But before we start plotting let's continue with the problems. 

Character traits are also a means of achieving conflict.  Many stories don't have enough built-in conflict, which leads to contrived plots.  But conflict isn't necessarily limited to the interplay of protagonist and antagonist.  We can create conflict by giving Tony a trait which clashes with Leonard's.  The opposite of impulsiveness isn't necessarily caution, though.  Going back to the Inner Traits tab on Tony's record, we select Thoughtful from the Shrewdness trait:

It's tempting to fill up the screen, by selecting other inner traits at this time, but it's better for the story to focus on just one or two traits in a character.  

We can clarify the problems further.  The Resolution tab on the Problem form identifies the outcome of a problem. The outcome of the story's major outer or external problem is the most important; the story's over when this problem is resolved.  In this case, though, we might solve both problems at once, in a confrontational scene. Let's assume that we want a happy ending, and think about the inner problem's outcome:

Does this work?  The story's over when Lacas is captured, and Leonard's inner problem, his impulsiveness, which might have gotten him killed, ends in his rescue.  The question is whether he learns and grows from the experience.  In an action-oriented story, this is less important, so we'll leave it alone for now.  However, it's worth coming back to; our story's theme will probably have to do with this character flaw (for example, 'Imprudence leads to danger'.)
