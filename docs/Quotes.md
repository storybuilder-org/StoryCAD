Who understands writing better than writers? The Quotes tool provides some of that... <br/>

Selecting this item from the Tools menu will cause a randomly selected quote about the craft of writing to be displayed. <br/>

The Preferences form, invoked from the File menu, can specify that a quote be displayed each time StoryBuilder starts, if you wish. <br/>
