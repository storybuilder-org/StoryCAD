 Backstory is what happened to your character before the story. It’s usually introduced as explanation  for traits or beliefs- as the root of a character’s motivations or reactions to story situations.

Backstory deserves caution for two reasons, however. If you’re shoehorning explanations for your character’s behavior into backstory, it can easily feel contrived. Also, it’s not easy to reveal backstory as your story unfolds. It’s a major cause of the dreaded ‘data dump.’
