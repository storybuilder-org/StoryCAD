### Setting Tab
Setting Tab


The Setting tab contains elements which make the setting specific and unique.

 
![](../media/Setting-Setting-Tab.png)

Locale	The location of the setting in space.

Season	These locate the setting in time.
Period

Lighting	These help to define the setting as a source of mood and atmosphere
Weather
Temperature	

Props	These elements make the scene specific for the characters, and therefore for the reader. An ashtray that a character nervously rocks back and forth is a prop. Props give characters little things to do (‘business’, in stage 

If a setting is used in multiple scenes, but the significance of the setting changes, with a different atmosphere or props, you may want to create a separate outline entry for the new setting.
