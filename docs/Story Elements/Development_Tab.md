### Development Tab

![](../media/Scene-Development-Tab.png)

This tab poses four questions that can guide the crafting of the scene:

**Purpose of Scene** - What does this scene need to accomplish in the story? A scene can and should accomplish more than one thing.

**Scene Type** - What kind of scene is this (action, dialog, exposition, etc.)?

**What if?** - What could go wrong, or what alternatives exist?

**Notes** - Additional notes about the scene's development.
