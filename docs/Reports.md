Clicking Generate will cause all of the selected reports to print on your default printer. <br/>

Scrivener Reports <br/>

If you use Scrivener, clicking Scrivener Reports will open a file picker to allow you to select a Scrivener .scrivx file from a Scrivener project. The Scrivener project you select is the one you’ll be writing your draft in, and it must have been created before you generate the reports. <br/>

A convenient way to use these embedded reports is to split your screen, with one pane open to a text node in the Manuscript and the other to a node in the outline: <br/>
