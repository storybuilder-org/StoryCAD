## Backups: Protecting Your Work ##
Protecting Your Work <br/>


Experienced computer users never underestimate the importance of a backup.  A power failure or computer crash, or a slip of the hand, can cost you the changes you've made since you last backed up your work. <br/>

The easiest and best backup is to save your work frequently at places where you're satisfied with your progress--- milestones such as adding a plot point for an important scene, describing the physical appearance of a character, or figuring out how you plan to resolve a story problem. When you modify your outline, StoryCAD will display a red pencil on the status bar to indicate that  it’s in an ‘unsaved’ state. Use the File | Save option to cause the outline to be re-written to disk. <br/>

Backups are written to the folder specified in the ‘Backup directory’ selection in Preferences. Use  the browse button next to the specified folder to select (or create) the folder you wish to keep your story outline backups in. We recommend creating a folder just for this purpose. <br/>

Backups are suffixed with a date timestamp, for example: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My Story as of 11 01 2022 17 12 16.stbx <br/>

To revert to a backup, simply click on the .stbx file of your choice and use File | Save As to save it back where you want it. If you specify the same parent folder as your working outline, it’ll overlay it. <br/>

See Preferences in this manual for further information. <br/>
