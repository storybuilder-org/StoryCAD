Character Names <br/>

The Male First Names,  Female First Names, and Last Names tools can be selected from the Characterization Aids sub-menu of the Tools menu.  These menu entries will cause a list of common names to appear to help you in selecting a name for your character. <br/>

All three of these lists can be tailored to your preferences. See "Customizing StoryBuilder" for details on how to add, delete, or modify the lists. <br/>
