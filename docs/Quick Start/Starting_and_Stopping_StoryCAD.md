## Starting and Stopping StoryCAD

### Starting StoryCAD on Windows

To start StoryCAD on Windows, use any of these methods:

- Click the StoryCAD icon from the **Start Menu**
- Click a pinned StoryCAD icon on the **Taskbar**
- Double-click a StoryCAD desktop shortcut (if you created one)

The StoryCAD main window will be displayed.

### Starting StoryCAD on macOS

To start StoryCAD on macOS, use any of these methods:

- Open from the **Applications** folder in Finder
- Click the StoryCAD icon in the **Dock** (if pinned)
- Launch from **Launchpad**

The StoryCAD main window will be displayed.

### Exiting StoryCAD

You can leave StoryCAD at any time by either:
- Selecting **Exit** from the File Menu
- Pressing the main window's **Close (X)** button

If you have unsaved changes, StoryCAD will prompt you to save before exiting.

### Window Management

StoryCAD follows regular platform conventions. The app can be resized, maximized, or minimized.

**Single Instance**: You can only have one instance of StoryCAD open at once. If you try to open another instance while the first one is open, it will instead bring the original instance forward.

### Platform Differences

Windows and macOS versions have identical outlining functionality. See [Platform Differences](../Front%20Matter/Platform_Differences.html) for details on text editing differences between platforms.
