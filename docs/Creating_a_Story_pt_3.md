### Creating a Story pt 3 ###
While we're at it, let's add a third character, another detective who's a partner for Leonard.  We'll give him the name Tony Irwin.

Why a third character?  There's no concrete reason at this point in the concept development, but policemen often work in teams.  Besides, with two detectives, there's someone to talk to.  At some point in the story we're likely to need to narrate events, to explain what's going on.  'Buddy' roles are good for that.  And if we don't need Tony, a touch of the Delete button can always get rid of him.

At this point all three characters are stick figures, just names and roles.  But that's okay, we're making progress.

Next, let's turn our attention to the key piece, the story problems.  The short definition for story is trouble; without story problems there is no story.  Your early focus in developing the concept should be to identify a specific protagonist with a specific problem.

Clicking on the Problem entry on the menu bar takes you to the Problem form, and clicking on the Add button adds a problem to the story outline:

This is a 'cops and robbers' story, and these are often action-oriented.  Let's stick to that approach; Leonard's basic problem is to catch Charlie.  This defines the Problem Type as Conflict  and the Conflict Type as Person vs. Person.  The basic idea for this story was a situation or subject, so we know that, too.  If our original idea had been a character or setting, nailing down the problem subject would be a priority, and the list of Subject values could have been useful.  Or we might have started with a Goal for the Protagonist and found a Subject which interfered with that Goal.

We can also take a stab at the Story Question:

While the cursor is still on Story Question, try pressing the [F1] key to see what Help looks like.  You can invoke Help for any control on any form. 

The story problem is still pretty vague.  For one thing, it needs to be a difficult problem; if Leonard and Tony go out and arrest Charlie in the first scene, the story's over before it begins.  Charlie has to be hard to catch; we have to make him so.  Focusing on our original idea again, let's say that Charlie is highly mobile, conducting his deals all over town, and that he uses pagers and cellular phones to arrange the deals.  The two detectives' problem, then, is how to overcome this technical advantage.

We can treat this issue of overcoming the advantage of the cellular phones as the major complication, on the way to solving the story problem.  Let's refine the Story Question for this one problem:
