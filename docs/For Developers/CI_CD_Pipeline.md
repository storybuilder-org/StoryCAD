# CI/CD Pipeline

StoryCAD uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, documentation deployment, and release distribution. This page documents all workflows, what they produce, and how to use them.

---

## Workflows Overview

| Workflow | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Build & Release | `build-release.yml` | Build, test, sign, and release for Windows and macOS |
| Deploy Jekyll site to Pages | `pages.yml` | Build and deploy the user manual to GitHub Pages |
| Sync Beta Manual | `sync-beta-manual.yml` | Sync docs from dev branch to the beta manual site |
| Publish to Microsoft Store | `store-publish.yml` | Submit Windows packages to the Microsoft Store |

---

## Build & Release

**File:** `.github/workflows/build-release.yml`

### Triggers

- **Push** to `main` or `dev` (ignores markdown, docs, and images)
- **Pull request** to `main` or `dev`
- **Manual** via `workflow_dispatch` with:
  - `version` (required): Tag/version string, e.g. `v4.0.0`
  - `skip_release` (optional, default: true): Build only, skip creating a GitHub release

### Platform Matrix

| Runner | RID | Architecture | Output |
|--------|-----|-------------|--------|
| `windows-latest` | win-x64 | x64 | MSIX package |
| `windows-latest` | win-x86 | x86 | MSIX package |
| `windows-11-arm` | win-arm64 | ARM64 | MSIX package |
| `macos-latest` | osx-arm64 | arm64 | PKG installer |

### What It Does

1. **Changelog generation** (release builds only): Fetches raw release notes from the GitHub API, then transforms them into a user-friendly format via OpenAI. Falls back to raw notes if the API key is unavailable.

2. **Build and test**: Restores packages, updates version numbers in `Package.appxmanifest` and `StoryCADLib.csproj`, runs tests on all platforms, then packages.

3. **Code signing**:
   - **Windows**: Decodes a base64-encoded PFX certificate from secrets and signs the MSIX package during build.
   - **macOS**: Creates a temporary keychain, imports Apple Distribution certificates, signs the app bundle and dylibs, then builds a signed PKG installer.

4. **Artifact upload**: Each platform/architecture uploads its package as a GitHub Actions artifact.

5. **Release creation** (when `skip_release` is false): Downloads all artifacts and creates a GitHub release with the generated changelog.

### Versioning

- **Release builds** (`workflow_dispatch` with `skip_release=false`): Uses the provided version string verbatim (e.g. `4.0.0`).
- **Draft/CI builds**: Uses `major.minor.run_number.65534` format, where `65534` indicates a non-release build.

### Artifacts

After a successful build, artifacts are available on the Actions run page:

- `storycad-msix-win-x64.zip` — Windows x64 MSIX package
- `storycad-msix-win-x86.zip` — Windows x86 MSIX package
- `storycad-msix-win-arm64.zip` — Windows ARM64 MSIX package
- `storycad-osx-arm64.pkg` — macOS PKG installer

### Required Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `BASE64_ENCODED_PFX` | Windows code signing certificate (base64) |
| `PFX_PASSWORD` | Password for the PFX certificate |
| `ENV` | Environment variables file for the app |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Optional: AI-enhanced changelog generation |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATES_BASE64` | macOS signing certificates (base64) |
| `APPLE_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password for macOS certificates |
| `MACOS_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64` | macOS provisioning profile (base64) |

---

## Deploy Jekyll Site to Pages

**File:** `.github/workflows/pages.yml`

### Triggers

- **Push** to `main` or `gh-pages`
- **Pull request** (build only, no deployment)
- **Manual** via `workflow_dispatch`

### What It Does

Builds the Jekyll user manual site and deploys it to GitHub Pages at [manual.storybuilder.org](https://manual.storybuilder.org/). On pull requests, it only validates the build without deploying.

---

## Sync Beta Manual

**File:** `.github/workflows/sync-beta-manual.yml`

### Triggers

- **Push** to `dev` when files under `docs/` change
- **Manual** via `workflow_dispatch`

### What It Does

Syncs the `docs/` directory from the `dev` branch to the external [BetaManual repository](https://github.com/storybuilder-org/BetaManual) using `rsync`. This keeps the beta documentation site at [beta.manual.storybuilder.org](https://beta.manual.storybuilder.org/) up to date with the latest development changes.

### Required Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `BETA_MANUAL_PAT` | Personal access token for the BetaManual repository |

---

## Publish to Microsoft Store

**File:** `.github/workflows/store-publish.yml`

### Triggers

- **Release published**: Automatically submits when a GitHub release is created
- **Manual** via `workflow_dispatch` with a release tag

### What It Does

Builds a Store-ready MSIX package (using `StoreUpload` mode with signing disabled, since the Store re-signs packages), then submits it to the Microsoft Store via the `msstore` CLI.

### Required Secrets

| Secret | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `PARTNER_CENTER_TENANT_ID` | Azure AD tenant ID |
| `PARTNER_CENTER_SELLER_ID` | Partner Center seller ID |
| `PARTNER_CENTER_CLIENT_ID` | Azure AD app client ID |
| `PARTNER_CENTER_CLIENT_SECRET` | Azure AD app client secret |

### Setup

Before this workflow can run, you need to:

1. Register an Azure AD application in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Associate it with your Partner Center account
3. Add the four secrets above to the repository's GitHub Actions secrets
4. Ensure at least one manual submission has been completed in Partner Center
