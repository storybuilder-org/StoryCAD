## Acknowledgements

#### Contributors

Any complex undertaking, such as writing a novel, creating a
complex piece of software, or a marriage, requires cooperation.

We would like to express our sincere appreciation and gratitude 
to those whose generous ideas and time helped make StoryCAD possible.
If we've missed anyone's contribution, our sincere apologies. Let us know
and we'll rectify that.

**Thanks go to these wonderful people:**

* Jake Shaw     
* Mylo
* Tina
* Tim        
* Syncfusion

#### Software

StoryCAD uses or links to the following software:

* [WinUI 3][1]
* [Windows App SDK][2]
* [Windows Community Toolkit][3]
* [Elmah.io][4]
* [NRtfTree][5]
* [Scrivener][6]

We are especially grateful to elmah.io commercial products who make their
livelihood freely available to public open source projects like ours.

(StoryCAD Versions before 2.14.2 relied on SyncFusion Controls and we are 
eternally greatful for their support.)

#### Origins

Hi, I'm Terry Cox. 

I started StoryCAD as a hobby, for my own attempts at fiction writing, back  in the late 1980's.
It began to attract attention at writer's conferences 
(I had a very early laptop), and in the early 90's I had the dubious idea of polishing
it and selling it commercially. StoryCAD had modest success, selling over 3,000 
copies, but inevitably software rot set in as my day job consumed more of time and
energy, and first fell into disuse and then became unusable. The original StoryCAD
is the ancestor of this one version.

After I retired, I had the idea of rewriting StoryCAD and selling it again,
and started down that road. However, looking at my tired old face in the mirror one 
morning, I came to realize that I wasn't interested in going into business again. I
wasn't interested in scrapping my project either, which realization led to the decision
to distribute StoryCAD as free and open source software (FOSS).

I'm pleased with how it's developing and I hope you find it useful.

#### Software Influences

Unless I'm deluding myself, this version of StoryCAD is a better program
than the original. That's because I know the trick of how to write better
software: You shamelessly shamelessly good ideas and code patterns from other developers.
Five individuals and their work deserve mention for this reason.

MVVM Light was one of the most influential early MVVM projects. Although it's fallen
into disuse, it was a direct influence on [Windows Community Toolkit MVVM][3],

The navigation tree and details panel design is very old; it was one of the early driving
forces in the creation of C++. StoryCAD V1 used it (poorly.) When StoryCAD V2
was just a vague idea, this small project suggested a way forward.

This project lead me toward UWP, and the birth of the WinUI 3 project cemented the 
way forward. XamlBrewer is a great stylist and his posts are always worth reading.
