Website Form
The website form allows you store and view web pages easily and functions like a 			smaller version of your web browser. The URL you’re browsing is kept in the form.

This is the search bar, if you have a website link (URL) then you can paste it here and 		after clicking the search button it will load the website. Conversely if you don’t have a 		URL you can search a query such as a map of the world and it will search it using 
Google.

Example -  Planning out a fictional character.

1) Create a new website node, you can do this by right clicking a node and  then clicking then clicking the webpage icon (ALT + W).

We have now got a map of our fictional word and can start planning our story around this fictional world.

Note: The Website Form requires the Microsoft Edge WebView 2 runtime, most 		Windows computers will already have this installed by default however if you are for any reason missing it, StoryCAD will ask to install it for you.
