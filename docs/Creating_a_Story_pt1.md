Creating a Story

[tk: This is complete and workable, but the story’s dated. Think about punching it up.]


The best  way to learn about StoryBuilder is to actually create a story with it.  That's what this tutorial is for.  We'll create a story outline with StoryBuilder and show you exactly what we did at each step along the way.

Every story starts with an idea. The idea might come from anywhere.  A conversation might lead to a bit of dialog; someone you see in a crowd could suggest an interesting character; a newspaper article or story you're read or movie you've seen might spark an idea for a conflict.  But regardless of where the idea comes from or how complete it is, at the moment of conception it's all you have, so a good place to start is to capture the idea.

Click on the StoryBuilder icon.  A Loading form will appear and StoryBuilder will load and initialize itself.  After a delay of a few seconds, you'll see a blank form like 
this:

Our idea started with a television news piece which showed young gang members, boys as young as fourteen, selling drugs on the street.  We were stricken by the image of these young criminals using advanced technology such as cellular phones and pagers, and thought there was a story in there someplace.  The Story Idea and Notes section on the Story Overview is a good place to record the idea it led to:

You'll notice that the Author, Date Created and Last Changed fields are already filled in.  The author's name is taken from your name as entered when you installed StoryBuilder.  For a new outline, Date Created is today's date, and for a new or old outline, and Last Changed is the computer date on which a change to the outline was last made.

While we're here, we might as well fill out a few other items.  Let's assign a Title to the not-yet-story.  "Danger Calls" isn't much of a title, but we can always change it later.


Type is the dramatic form we'll use.  Click on the down arrow to the right of this control, and a list of possibilities appears:

You can select one of these choices by clicking on it  (Short Story, in this case), or you can key your own type in, if perhaps you want to tell this story as an epic poem. Likewise, we'll select Suspense for the Genre.  We'll leave the other controls blank for now.  

At the moment, the story outline for "Danger Call" is in the computer's RAM memory, but  not saved to disk.  Let's save what we've done so far.  From the File menu, select Save As.  The Save As dialog is displaying your hard drive's root directory as the current directory.  This is the initial specification for the default directory to keep StoryBuilder outlines in.  You can change the default from the Preferences form, which is invoked from the File menu.  The dialog also shows '*.STB' as a pattern for the filename.  The '.STB' file suffix is the default for StoryBuilder outlines.  We'll save our story idea as DANGER.STB in the C:\TEMP directory (the directory could be different on your system.)

Every story outline is a separate file.  This is a regular DOS file, and can be copied, backed up, etc.  The file is a folder of records which contain the different elements in our story outline. Our file folder is relatively empty at this point, but let's quit anyway.  We'll come back after a break to work on our story idea some more.  From the File menu, select Exit to leave StoryBuilder and return to Windows.
