## Getting Help
We suggest you first use this manual to try to find the information you’re looking for.

[The StoryBuilder Discord Server](https://discord.gg/g7jjtgBKsQ) contains a ‘frequently-asked-questions’ channel, and a ‘writers-chat’ channel.

Currently StoryCAD’s only direct support mechanism is to email support@storybuilder.org.
You can email directly or use [this form](https://storybuilder.org/contact-us/), there's no difference.

Please write us with ideas or suggestions for improvements. We want to make StoryCAD the best possible tool to help you achieve your fiction writing goals.
