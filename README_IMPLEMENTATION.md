# Issue 1068 Implementation Ready

This branch is ready to begin implementation of the comprehensive plan developed for GitHub issue #1068: Route all UI and API code through OutlineServices.

## Implementation Status
- [x] Planning phase complete
- [x] Implementation plan documented and attached to issue
- [x] TDD cycles defined with detailed test cases
- [x] Code locations identified (31 direct access patterns)
- [x] Architecture separation defined
- [ ] **Awaiting final approval to begin implementation**

## Next Steps
Once approved, implementation will proceed through 6 TDD cycles:
1. SetChanged Method
2. GetStoryElementByGuid Method  
3. UpdateStoryElement Method
4. GetCharacterList Method
5. UpdateStoryElementByGuid Method
6. GetSettingsList and GetAllStoryElements Methods

Each cycle follows the TDD pattern: failing tests → implementation → passing tests → refactoring.
